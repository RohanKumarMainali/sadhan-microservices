## Sadhan (Vehicle Rental System) 
This project is revamp of my college final year project Sadhan: https://github.com/RohanKumarMainali/Sadhan-Backend which was built in express.js and React.js. The entire project will be broken down into several microservices and should be built using Java Spring Boot and Go. 


## Must Have
1) Spring Security
2) Good architecture and loose-coupling if possible
3) Deploy using k8s
4) Tackle fault tolerence and resillience
5) Use service discovery
6) Use service mesh
7) Use Kafka

## Low priority items

1) UI
2) Fully functional system is not required as this project is just for learning purpose.
